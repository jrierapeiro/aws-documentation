- Stream
- Producers
  - Producers are devices that collect data for Kinesis processing
  - You build producers to continuously input data into a Kinesis stream
  - Producers can include IoT sensors, Mobile devices, etc..
  - You can have thousands of different producers.
- Consumers
  - They consume the streamâ€™s data, this is done concurrently (multiple consumers can consume the same data at the same time): Real-time dashboards, S3, Redshift, EMR
- Shards
  - The more data you want to process, the more shards you add to your Kinesis stream
  - Each shard can process 2MB o read data per second, and 1MB of write data per second
