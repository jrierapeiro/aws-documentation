- Amazon EMR is a service which deploys out EC2 instances based off of the Hadoop big data framework.
- EMR is used to analyze and process vast amounts of data
- EMR also supports other distributed frameworks, such as Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink
- Workflow:
  - Data is stored in S3, DynamoDB, or Redshift is sent to EMR
  - The data is mapped to a cluster of Hadoop Master/Slave nodes for processing.
  - Computations (coded/created by the developer) are used to process the data.
  - The process data is then reduced to a single output set of return information.
- Facts:
  - You (admin) has the ability to access the underlying operating system.
  - You can add user data to EC2 instances launched into the cluster via bootstrapping
  - EMR takes advantage of parallel processing for faster processing data.
  - You can resize a running cluster at any time, and you can deploy multiple clusters.
