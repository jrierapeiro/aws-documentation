- A role is something that another entity can assume (acquires the specific permissions)
- Roles must be used because policies cannot be directly attached to AWS services.
- Note: An EC2 instance can only have one role attached at a time (can be changed)
- Other users can assume a role for temporary access to AWS accounts and resources => Identity Provider Access role
- AWS account can have 250 roles
