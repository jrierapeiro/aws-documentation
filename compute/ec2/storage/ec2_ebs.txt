- EBS volumes are persistent, meaning that they can live beyond the life of the EC2 instance they are attached to (Only if instructed to when created)
- They are network attached storage, meaning they can be attached/detached to or from various EC2 instances
- They can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time
- They have the benefit of being backed up into a snapshot (restore later)
- Can be stopped
- Can be up to 1 or 2 Tb depending on the OS.
- It is terminated by default when the instance is terminated (can be changed)
- Other EBS volumes attached to the instance are preserved 
- EC2 Metrics: By default there would always be some NetworkIn, NetworkOut, CPU utilization but the DiskRead(bytes) would remain 0 for an EBS backed instance.
