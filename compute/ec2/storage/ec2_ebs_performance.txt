- Measure input/output operations in IOPS:
  - IOPS are input.output operations per second
  - 256KB chunks or smaller (bigger are splitted in chunks)
- They will receive their maximum performance at the moment they are created
- Volumes created from an EBS snapshot must be initialized (reading all the block to avoid this impact in production)
