- Instance types describe the hardware components that an EC2 instance will run on:
  - Compute power (processor/vCPU)
  - Memory (ram)
  - Storage options/optimization (hard drive)
  - Network performance (bandwidth)
- Types:
  - General purpose: t2, m3
  - Compute optimized: c3, c4
  - Storage optimized: d2, i2
  - GPU optimized: g2, p2
  - Memory optimized: r3/r4, x1
