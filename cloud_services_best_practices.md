# Cloud services - Best practices

- Design for failure, and create self-healing applications
- Always design application with instances in at least two AZs
- Guarantee that you have reserved capacity in the event of an emergency by purchasing reserved instances in a designated recovery AZ
- Always enable RDS Multi-AZ and automated backups (InnoDb for MySQL)
- Utilize Elastic IP addresses for failover to standby instances when auto scaling and load balancing are not available
- Use route 53 to implement failover DNS techniques:
  - Latency based routing
  - Failover DNS routing
- Have a disaster recovery and backup strategy that utilizes:
  - Multiple regions
  - Maintain up to date AMIâ€™s
  - Copy EBs snapshots to other regions
  - Automate everything in order to easily re-deploy resources in event of a disaster
  - Utilize bootstrapping to quickly bring up new instances with minimal configuration and allows for generic AMIs
- Decouple application components using services such as SQS
- Throw away old broken instances
- Utilize CloudWatch to monitor infrastructure changes and health
- Utilize MultiPartUpload for S3 uploads (objects >> 100 MB)
- Cache static content on Amazon CloudFront using EC2 or S3 origins
- Protect your data in transit by using HTTPS/SSL endpoint 
- Protect data at rest using encrypted file systems or EBS/S3 encryption options
- Connect to instances inside of the VPC using a bastion host or VPN connection
- Use IAM roles on EC2 instances instead of using API keys, never store API keys on an AMI
