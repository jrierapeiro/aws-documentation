- It is the pure definition of infrastructure as code:
  - You can convert your application’s architecture into a JSON formatted template
  - You can then use that JSON template to deploy out updated or replicated copies of that architecture to multiple regions
- Benefits:
  - Saves time. You don’t have to manually create duplicate architecture in additional regions
  - Since your infrastructure is now code, you can version control it. Allowing for rollbacks to previous versions of it if a new version has issues.
  - Allows for backups of your infrastructure
  - Great solution for disaster recovery
- Templates: Metadata, Parameters, Mappings, Conditions, Transform, Resources, Outputs
