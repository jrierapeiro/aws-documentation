- Proactive Cycle Scaling: Scaling that occurs at a fixed interval
- Proactive Event-based scaling: Scaling that occurs in anticipation of an event.
- Auto-scaling based on demand: Scaling that occurs based off of increase in demand for the application
- Plan to scale out rather than up (horizontal scaling):
  - Add more EC2 instances to handle increases in capacity rather than increasing instance size
  - Be sure to design for the proper instance size to start
  - Use tools like Auto scaling and ELB
  - A scaled service should be fault tolerant and operationally efficient
  - Scalable service should become more cost effective as it grows
- DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL service from AWS:
  - With high availability and scaling already built in
  - All the developer has to do is specify required throughput for the tables
- RDS requires scaling in a few different ways:
  - RDS does not support a cluster of instances to load balance traffic across
  - Scale RDS:
    - Utilize read replicas to offload heavy read only traffic
    - Increase the instance size to handle increase in load
    - Utilize ElastiCache clusters for caching database session information
