# Services - Simple Work Flow
- SWF is a fully managed workflow service provided by AWS
- It allows an architect/developer to implement distributed, asynchronous applications as a workflow.
- A workflow coordinates and manages the execution of activities that can be run asynchronously across multiple computing devices
- SWF has consistent execution
- Guarantees the order in which tasks are executed
- The SWF service is primarily an API which an application can integrate its workflow service into. This allows the service to be used by non-AWS services such as an on-premise data center.
- A workflow execution can last up to 1 year
