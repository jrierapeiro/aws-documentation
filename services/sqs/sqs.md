# Services - Simple Quere Service
- SQS provides the ability to have hosted/highly available queues that can be used for messages being sent between servers.
- This allows for the creation of distributed/decoupled application components.
- SQS is used to create decoupled application environments
- It is also highly available and redundant
- Messages between servers are retrieved through polling
  - Long polling (1-20 sec):
    - Allows the SQS service to wait until a message is available in a queue before sending a response, and will return all messages from all SQS services.
    - It reduces API requests
  - Short polling
    - SQS samples a subset of servers and returns messages from just those servers.
    - Will not return all possible messages in a poll.
    - Increases API request which increases costs
- Workflow
  - Generally a worker instance will poll a queue to retrieve waiting messages for processing.
  - Auto scaling can be applied based off of queue size so that if a component of your application has an increase in demand, the number of worker instances can increase
