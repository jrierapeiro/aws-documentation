# Test security
- AWS customers should undertake a number of test approaches:
  - External vulnerability assessment: A third party evaluates system vulnerabilities with little or no knowledge of the infrastructure and its components.
  - External penetration tests: A third party with little or no knowledge of the system tries to break into it, in a controlled fashion.
  - Internal Gray/White-box review of applications and platforms: A tester who has some or full knowledge of the system validates the efficiency of controls in place, or evaluates applications and platforms for known vulnerabilities.
