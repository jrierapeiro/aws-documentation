- S3 versioning is a feature to manage and store all old/new/deleted versions of an object
- By default, versioning is disabled on all buckets/objects
- Once versioning is enabled, you can only suspend versioning. It cannot be fully disabled. Suspending versioning only prevents new versions from being created. All objects with existing versions will maintain their older versions.
- Versioning can only set on the bucket level and applies to all objects in the bucket
- Lifecycle policies can be applied to specific versions of an object
- Versioning and lifecycle policies can both be enabled on a bucket at the same time
- Versioning can be used with lifecycle policies to create a great archiving and backup solution in S3.
