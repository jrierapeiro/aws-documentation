- It is used to monitor AWS services, such as EC2, ELB and S3.
- You monitor your environment by configuring and viewing CloudWatch metrics.
- Metrics are specific to each AWS service or resource, and include such metrics as:
  - EC2 per instance metrics (cpu utilization, cpu credit usage)
    - Memory or swap metrics requires third party perl scripts
  - S3 metrics (number of objects, bucket size bytes)
  - ELB metrics (request count, unhealthy hosts count)
- Detailed vs basic level monitoring
  - Basic: Data is available automatically in 5-min periods at no charge
  - Detailed: Data is available in 1-min periods
- CloudWatch alarms can be created to trigger alerts (or other actions in your AWS accounts, such as a SNS topic), based on threshold you set on CloudWatch metrics.
- Auto scaling heavily utilizes CloudWatch, relying on threshold and alarms to trigger the addition or removal of instances from an auto scaling group.
- Used for:
  - Shutting down inactive instances
  - Monitoring changes in your AWS environment with CloudTrail integration
  - Monitor instances resources and create alarms based off of usage and availability
