- ACLs operate at the network/subnet level.
- They support allow and deny rules for traffic traveling into or out of a subnet.
- They are stateless: so return traffic must be allowed through an outbound rule.
- They process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic. 
- The last rule in every ACL is a catch all deny rule.
- It is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as firewall for controlling traffic in and out for one or more subnets.
- A subnet can only be associated with one NACL at a time
