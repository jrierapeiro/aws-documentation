- Cross network connection: It is the physical connection between your network and the DC authorized partner, which then handles the routes and connections to AWS networks.
- Public virtual interface:
  - Allows to connect to public AWS endpoints
  - Requires a CIDR block range
- Private virtual interface:
  - Can only communicate with internal IP addresses inside of EC2
  - It works like a VPN
  - For best practice, use two DC connections for active-active or active-failover availability.
  - You can use VPN as backup of DC
  - You can create multiple PVI to multiple VPCs at the same time.
